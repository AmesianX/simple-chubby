\section{Introduction}

We implement a distributed lock service called SimpleChubby
similar to the original Google Chubby lock service\cite{burrows2006chubby}.
It is intended to help implement distributed synchronization.

SimpleChubby exposes a simple Unix-like file system interface
combined with lock primitives and event notifications.
Leveraging such interface, we build three distributed synchronization
applications, namely leader election, group membership, and distributed barriers.

SimpleChubby uses a server-client architecture,
and we put great efforts to achieve fault tolerance
where \cite{burrows2006chubby} does not provide many details.
Server fault tolerance is achieved by combining the Viewstamp protocol \cite{oki1988viewstamped}
(which we implement from scratch) and a server-client cooperation mechanism
to recover non-persistent server states.
Server failure is transparent to users, and client failure
is handled correctly by reclaiming its holding locks.

In the following,
SimpleChubby API and its semantics are described in section~\ref{section:api},
the system architecture and normal-case processing mechanism
are described in section~\ref{section:normal},
the fault tolerance mechanism is discussed in section~\ref{section:failure},
and in section~\ref{section:apps},
three applications are shown to illustrate
how SimpleChubby API is used to build
distributed synchronization applications
and give a detailed description about the system workflow.
