\section{User API and Semantics}
\label{section:api}

SimpleChubby provides an interface identical to the Chubby API~\cite{burrows2006chubby},
which exports a file system interface similar to, but simpler than that of UNIX.
It consists of a strict tree of files and directories. Both files and directories
are called \emph{nodes}. We support node creation and deletion, content
read and write, lock operations, and event subscription.
All the operations from all the clients are serialized at the server.

FileHandlerId open(const string &fname,
        Mode mode);
void close(FileHandlerId fdId);
bool delete(FileHandlerId fdId);

/* Content read and write */
bool getContentsAndStat(FileHandlerId fdId,
        FileContent *content,
        MetaData *data);
bool setContents(FileHandlerId fdId,
        const FileContent &content);

/* Lock operations */
void acquire(FileHandlerId fdId);
bool tryAcquire(FileHandlerId fdId);
void release(FileHandlerId fdId);

/* Event subscription */
void registerEvent(ChubbyEvent e,
        EventCallback cb);
void deleteEvent(ChubbyEvent e);
\end{lstlisting}

The full list of the API is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:api}.
Applications use \texttt{Open()} to create a handler associated with a node
handler, and the other functions all operate on the handler.
We simplify the \texttt{Open()} interface by removing the parent handler and
always specifying absolute path.
The \texttt{mode} argument in the \texttt{Open()} function specifies the
read/write mode. We also support create ephemeral nodes, which will be
removed automatically when the connection fails.

The clients may also subscribe to a range of events, including ``file contents
modified'' and ``lock state changed'', using the \texttt{mode} argument when
opening files. The events are delivered to the clients asynchronously.
The event handler callback functions are supplied by user applications and
registered beforehand, which will be called by the client library when
corresponding events are received.

Our API supports a simplified failure model of Chubby. The server failures
are transparent to user applications if the connection can be reconstructed
within a certain grace period, otherwise an exception will be exposed to
the applications and all the locks it holds are assumed to be invalid.

The user applications can use this API to perform various synchronization
jobs. We provide two examples in Section~\ref{section:apps}.
