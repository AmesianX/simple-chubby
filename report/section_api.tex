\section{User API and Semantics}
\label{section:api}

SimpleChubby provides an interface similar to the Chubby API~\cite{burrows2006chubby},
which exports a file system interface similar to, but simpler than that of UNIX.
It consists of a strict tree of files and directories. Both files and directories
are called \emph{nodes}. We support node creation and deletion, content
read and write, lock operations, and event subscription.
All the operations from all the clients are serialized at the leader server.

void release(FileHandlerId fdId);

/* Event subscription */
void registerEvent(ChubbyEvent e,
        EventCallback cb);
void deleteEvent(ChubbyEvent e);

The full list of the API is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:api}.
An application calls \texttt{fileOpen()} to retrieve a file handler
associated with an opened node. Similar to UNIX's implementation,
this function returns an integer type of identifier for each file handler,
which is used by all other functions in the API.
We simplify the \texttt{fileOpen()} interface by removing the argument of
the parent handler, and always specify an absolute path of a node.
The \texttt{mode} argument in the \texttt{fileOpen()} consists of a set of flags,
including \texttt{READ}/\texttt{WRITE} mode, and create \texttt{NEW\_DIRECTORY} flag.
By setting \texttt{EPHEMERAL} flag, a client can create ephemeral nodes,
which will be automatically removed when the connection fails.

Clients may also subscribe to a range of events during \texttt{fileOpen()},
including ``file contents modified'' and ``lock state changed'',
using the \texttt{mode} arguement.
The events are delivered to the clients asynchronously.
The event handler callback functions are supplied and registered by user
applications beforehand, and will be called by the client library when
corresponding events are received.

Our API supports a simplified failure model of Chubby. The server failures
are transparent to user applications if the connection can be reconstructed
within a certain grace period, otherwise an exception will be exposed to
the applications and all the locks it holds are assumed to be invalid.

The user applications can use this API to perform various synchronization
jobs. We provide three examples in Section~\ref{section:apps}.
