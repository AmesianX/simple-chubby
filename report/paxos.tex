SimpleChubby implements a replicated state machine to store the persistent
state of SimpleChubby servers, i.e., file content, lock ownership and etc.,
following the implementation described in \cite{mazieres2007paxos}.
It is based on a Viewstamp consensus protocol\cite{oki1988viewstamped},
and its view-change is implemented using Paxos\cite{lamport2001paxos}.

The consensus implementation runs in the same process
as the SimpleChubby server logic does.
And the leader in a Viewstamp view is appointed as the SimpleChubby leader server.

Our consensus implementation targets at a correct consensus behavior
rather than pushing hard for good performance.
The implementation can reliably replicate data across replicas,
achieve correct view change during server failures,
and bring a new-coming replica database up-to-date.
But leader lease as mentioned in the original Chubby paper is
not implemented,
and lots of operations are to be parallelized for performance.
To make our implementation simple,
a replica loses all its data and states after rebooting,
which increases the overhead of bringing up a reboot replica.

%\subsection{Implementation details}
%
%Servers communicate by remote procedure calls to achieve consensus,
%and the calls use the same signatures as in \cite{mazieres2007paxos}.
%
%The implementation proposed in \cite{mazieres2007paxos} is pretty clear,
%except for the concurrency model. So more details are given here.
%In our implementation, there are three important threads running in a replica.
%
%The first thread periodically checks the communication channel
%to the leader server.
%If the channel is down,
%a view change is initiated after a random timeout.
%The second thread responds to remote procedure calls from other replicas.
%It can perform such operations as replicating data,
%changing local view information,
%and modifying the local Paxos view change instance.
%The third thread replicates the data given by the SimpleChubby logic.
%
%The three threads are mostly asynchronized except when they access
%the local replica state. The local replica state includes but is not
%limited to
%whether the replica is ready to replica new data,
%which view the replica is in when it is ready,
%the Paxos instance states during a view change.
