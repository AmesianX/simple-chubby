A skeleton of the two applications we will show.

APPLICATION 1. Leader election.

Leader election is an application that elects one host out of a given group
of hosts as the leader. At any given time, at most one host among the
group is elected as the leader, and other hosts in the group are able to
find out which host is the leader, if it exists.

In SimpleChubby, the application is implemented as follow:

There is one file named "leader" that stores the identifier of the leader
if it exists.
1. Open the file "leader". Register the file modification event. Read the
file to figure out who is the leader if it exists.
2. Once the file "leader" is changed, read the file to figure out the new
leader if it exists. This is done synchronized.
3. Try to acquire the lock of the file, and once succeed, write the file to
record that the host that have acquired the lock is the owner.

Figuring out the leader, which means reading the file, does not require
locking.

Our implementation should be able to survive client side failure and server
side failure for this application.

APPLICATION 2. Double barrier.

Double barrier is a barrier that specifies a given number of hosts
to proceed as a group. When the number of hosts that enter the barrier
reaches the specified number, the same set of hosts will be allowed
to leave the barrier.

In SimpleChubby, the application is implemented as follow:

They will be two files, 'passed' and 'in_barrier'.
The specified number of the barrier is noted as Q.

1. Open the file 'in_barrier', and try to lock it.

2. After getting the lock, examine the file 'in_barrier' to figure out
which hosts are in the barrier:
2.1. If the host is the first one that enters the barrier, write in the file
that it enters the barrier and assigns a new barrier identification.
2.2. If the host is not the first one that enters the barrier and the number
of hosts that have entered the barrier (excluding itself) is less than Q-1, write in the file that it enters the barrier.
2.3. If the number of hosts that have entered the barrier is Q-1, write in
the file 'passed' that this barrier can be passed. Clean up the file
'in_barrier'.

3. After going through step 2, listen to the file modification event of the
file 'passed' to figure out when it can leave the barrier.

The implementation should survive server failure. When a client enters
a barrier and fails, it will be counted as one towards the specified number
Q.
